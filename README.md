To view live demo of website click here: [MEME-GENERATOR](https://alam-meme-generator.netlify.app/)

ABout Website:
    This website was created to make custom memes online .
    This works by hitting the API and fetching the images from a database of meme images.
    After that the image is displayed(you can use the fetched image or click "get a new image" to generate new image)
    After getting the desired image you can add texts to the image(on top and bottom) to modify your meme image
    Then with the help of HTML canava you can download your custom meme image locally on your PC/mobile devices.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
